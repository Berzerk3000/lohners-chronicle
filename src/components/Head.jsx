          An absent-minded man of mysteries, Franz Lohner relies on his bulging journal to keep track of occurrences,
          intrigues and arguments around Taal's Horn Keep. Sometimes his notes are even useful, believe it or not. The
          Franz Lohner Chronicles are extracts from that journal.
