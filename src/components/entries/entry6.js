Hello Franz, darling, it’s Sienna. If you’re reading this, then you already know I’ve found your little diary.

I have to say, I’m very impressed. Quite apart from the content – which is simply chock full of interesting bric-a-brac, if oddly miss-spelled in places – I adore those loving little doodles in the margins. Especially the ones of Saltzpyre. You’ve really captured his scowl – or rather, one of his many scowls. They do say that goblins have a hundred different words for ‘mushroom’. Our dear, gallant Victor is a bit like that, but with bleak facial expressions, don’t you find? Perhaps it’s only having the one eye that does it? Or having a shard of flint where his heart should be.

And speaking of hearts … Don’t think I didn’t spot where you’ve scrubbed out all those bits of conjecture about Kerillian and Markus. Never mind how I know what you’ve been writing – one is a wizard, darling, and you are a dull fellow at times. Such imagery! And all in rhyme, but honestly I don’t know where you got the idea in the first place. It’s best we draw a veil over the matter, don’t you think? At least, unless you’d rather I accidentally let the odd detail slip? I’d have to explain some of the longer words to dear Markus, bless him, but I’ve a feeling Kerillian would be rather faster on the uptake. And if Bardin finds out, he’ll only put it to music, and I shudder to think of the consequences.

And all because of your little diary. Hang on … there’s not something about me in here, is there?

Oh. Apparently not.

So … I’m not worth writing about, is that it? You can’t stop chattering on about the others, but poor little Sienna’s too boring, is she? Well, the things I could tell you!

I’ll have you know I’ve led a fascinating life, full of wisdom, excitement … and not one or two moments of indiscretion. Anecdotes that would make your toes curl. Tales of romance and daring from across the Old World. Intrigue. Danger. Excitement. Explosions!

Oh, the stories I could tell. And you’re never going to hear them. Not now. You’ve hurt my feelings.

How does it feel to be left out?

Being back at the Bright College, that’s what it feels like.`);
