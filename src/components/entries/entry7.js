Hello diary. I hope you don’t mind me addressing you, an inanimate object, as if you’re some kind of sentient being worthy of conversation? I know it’s unseemly.

Alas, you are my only real friend … probably because you have no eyes with which to see how often I scratch myself in unseemly ways, or ears to hear that strange whistling noise I make with my teeth while I scour my tiny mayfly brain for what passes as a useful thought.

Believe me, you’re much better off for it. If only the others were so blessed.

I come to you with a confession. I have recently realised that I must be much, much, much nicer to Kerillian. Or rather, to Lady Kerillian the Beautiful and All-Wise - as I should really start calling her. She is patently as far above me as I am above the worms churning the soil.

No.

Wait.

She is patently many times farther above me than I am above the worms churning the soil. I cannot give you a precise number, no, as counting makes my head hurt and my tongue itch.

Alas, it’s a source of constant, guilty shame that I do not readily prostrate myself and clean Lady Kerillian’s boots with my tongue. Which she would of course not allow, because my tongue – like the rest of me – is filthier than her boots ever get. Yes, even after she’s been forced to walk through yet another sewer because I arrogantly assumed that doing so was a good use of her time.

I understand now that Lady Kerillian’s longevity is no excuse for such poor planning on my part. I should be endlessly grateful for every moment she sees fit to grant me - me! - and never again ask her to join Bardin’s misguided attempt at a sing-song.

Let me see. What else? What else do I talk about all the time? Oh, that’s right.

Pumpkins.

Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins.

I love pumpkins. In fact, I sometimes wish I was one.

Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins. Pumpkins.

Yours, Franz Lohner, in pumpkin love.

Pumpkins.`);
